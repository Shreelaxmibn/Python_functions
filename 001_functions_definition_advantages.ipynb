    "        <li><strong>Modularity:</strong> Functions allow you to break down a complex program into smaller, manageable parts.</li>\n",
    "        <li><strong>Reusability:</strong> Functions reduce code duplication and make your code more concise.</li>\n",
    "        <li><strong>Abstraction:</strong> Functions provide an abstraction layer, focusing on what a function does, not how it does it.</li>\n",
    "        <li><strong>Readability:</strong> Well-named functions make your code more readable and understandable.</li>\n",
    "        <li><strong>Maintenance:</strong> Functions make code maintenance easier by isolating changes to specific tasks.</li>\n",

    "    <ul>\n",
    "        <li><strong>Code Reusability:</strong> Functions can be reused multiple times in your program or other projects.</li>\n",
    "        <li><strong>Modularity:</strong> Functions promote modular programming for easier development, debugging, and maintenance.</li>\n",
    "        <li><strong>Testing:</strong> Functions are testable units, making it easier to catch and fix bugs.</li>\n",
    "        <li><strong>Collaboration:</strong> Functions enable collaboration in team projects by allowing different team members to work on separate parts.</li>\n",
    "        <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> Functions help manage complexity as your program grows by adding or modifying functions.</li>\n",
    "        <li><strong>Documentation:</strong> Functions can have docstrings that serve as documentation for their purpose and usage.</li>\n",
    "        <li><strong>Error Handling:</strong> Functions can encapsulate error-handling logic, making your code more robust.</li>\n",
    "        <li><strong>Code Organization:</strong> Functions help organize your code logically, aiding in code navigation and understanding.</li>\n",
